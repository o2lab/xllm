          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 8      
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

    OPT   This kernel grid is too small to fill the available resources on this device, resulting in only 0.2 full      
          waves across all SMs. Look at Launch Statistics for more details.

    OPT   If you execute __syncthreads() to synchronize the threads of a block, it is recommended to have more than the 
          achieved 1 blocks per multiprocessor. This way, blocks that aren't waiting for __syncthreads() can keep the   
          hardware busy.

          This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (17.4%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

          optimizing occupancy.
